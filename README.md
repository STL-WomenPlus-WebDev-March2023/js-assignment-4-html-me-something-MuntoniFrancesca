# HTML Me Something

## Assignment Requirements

For this assignment, you are asked to create a web page about yourself 
with the following criteria:

   1. Use Git to initialize and track a new project
   1. Create content in HTML
   1. Style the page separately from the HTML with CSS
   1. Use Github to push the project remotely
   1. Bonus: Use Github Pages to host the page

This is a highly personalized and variable assignment. The final product
will look different for every student.

## How Your Assignment is Graded

### Grading Tests

Despite it's subjective nature, this assignment contains a few tests. These tests are looking to be sure a you have submitted a repository that includes a number of HTML elements and 
CSS rules defined in the instructions. 

To run the tests, open up the directory for your assignment in your terminal and run the following command: ``npm test``.

A passing assignment will have an output of: ``7 specs, 0 failures``.

If you believe that you have done everything correctly and you are still not getting 7 passing specs, please reach out to your TA for assistance.

Remember that these grading tests are just a starting point for your TA to start grading your work. 

### Beyond the Tests

After your TA runs the tests, they will be doing a code check to make sure that your project meets the following requirements:

1. You should have at *least* 2 commits. One for HTML and one for CSS.
1. Project content should be pushed to Github and you should have submitted the link to the remote repository on Canvas.
1. If you complete the bonus mission, then the project is hosted on Github pages.
1. In your HTML, you should have approximately 3 - 10 paragraphs and sections.
1. You should also have at least one of each of the following: 

   - `<p>`
   - `<header>`
   - `<footer>`
   - `<main>`
   - `<article>`
   - `<img>` - with images located in an ``images`` folder
   - `HTML entity <http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp>`__

1. In your HTML file, you should have no elements dictating style. Style rules should be applied with CSS selectors.
1. In your CSS, they will check that you have appropriate use of both margin and padding.
1. They will also check that you have style rules for at least one, hopefully more, of each selector type:
   
   a. element
   b. class
   c. id

1. Minimal, if any, document-level or inline style rules.

When you are done with the assignment, submit the link to your Github repo on Canvas!
