<h2>Cagliari</h2>
<p>
   <b>Cagliari</b> is the capital of Sardinia.<br>
   It's located about 30 minutes from Furtei, the village where I was born and raised. In Cagliari there is the university where I studied (Università degli Studi di Cagliari).<br>
   It's a beautiful city, you can walk everywhere, there are so many shops and little restaurants.<br><br>
   My favorite things to do in Cagliari are:
   <ul>
      <li>eating an ice cream (pistachio is my favorite flavour) while sitting in front of the port.</li>
      <li>drinking a cocktail at a place called Biffi.</li>
      <li>swim in the clear waters of the Poetto beach</li>
      </ul>
</p>

<h2>Barumini</h2>
<p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
   <b>Barumini</b> is very close to my village. It's known for Su Nuraxi, which was declared UNESCO World Heritage Site.<br>
   It's the most impressive and the most well-preserved inheritance left to us by the Nuragic civilization.<br>
   I visited it so many times, the history of this place is full of mistery and that's what fascinates me the most.<br>
   If I could travel back in time I would go back to the Nuragic era.

<h2>Golfo di Oristano</h2>
<p>
   Ahh the <b>Golfo di Oristano</b>, full of history and beautiful landscapes.<br>
   Oristano is famous for the Mont'e Prama giants, incredible sculptures created by the Nuragic civilization.<br><br>
   Things I love to do in the Golfo di Oristano:
   <ul>
      <li>going to the is Arutas beach</li>
      <li>drinking vernaccia</li>
      <li>visiting Michela, my best friend</li>
   </ul>
</p>

   <a name="alghero"></a>
<h2>Alghero</h2>
<p>
   I love walking through the streets of <b>Alghero</b>! This city is there since pre-historic times.<br>
   The Ozieri culture was present here in the 4th millenium BC (Necropolis Anghelu Ruju) and the Nuragic civilization settled there around 1500 BC.<br>
   This city was also colonized by Catalans and the population still talks using the Catalan dialect (it is now recognized as a minority language).<br>
   Alghero is also famous for the coral, there are multiple shops that sell beautiful (and expensive) coral jewelry.

   <a name="bosa"></a>
<h2>Bosa</h2>
<p>
   <b>Bosa</b> is so colorful! It was named best historical center of Italy a few years ago.<br>
   When there you can visit the Serravalle Castle. Bosa is also known for the Malvasia, a sweet and fruity wine.

   <a name="Baunei"></a>
<h2>Baunei</h2>
<p>
   If you go to Sardinia you cannot not go to <b>Baunei</b>! If you like hiking you should go to Cala Goloritzé.<br>
   This beautiful beach was closed to traffic of motorboats to preserve it from pollution and assault of tourists,<br>
   now it's only accessible walking for one hour and a half or by the sea (you can rent a boat then swim for 200 meters (650 feet)).
   If you hike there make sure to bring water!!

<h2>Cala Luna</h2>
<p>
   <b>Cala Luna</b> is beautiful, you can go there by boat or hiking.

   <a name="villasimius"></a>
<h2>Villasimius</h2>
<p>
   I worked in <b>Villasimius</b> for three summers in a bar/gelateria and, beside working and going to the beach, I had the privilege to eat all the gelato that I wanted!<br>
   This is such a pretty village, it'a also called "the pearl of the south" in the summer every night there is a market in the main street called "via del mare".

   <a name="lamaddalena"></a>
<h2>La Maddalena</h2>
<p>
   <b>La Maddalena</b> lends its name to the whole archipelago, of which it is the largest island, and the national park of which it is the administrative centre.<br>
   Things I like to do in La Maddalena:
   <ul>
      <li>rent a boat and explore the small islands of the archipelago</li>
      <li>drink a cocktail at a place called The Duke</li>
      <li>going to Caprera and visit Garibaldi's house</li>
      <li>walk around the village</li>
   </ul>
